# stock-web-application

## Part One  General Introduction

This is a Python project to create your own stock dashboard and have a prediction on tomorrows stock price.
In this project I created two dashboard to interactively analyse and visualize specific stock data.
#### 1. Stock Price Visualization
The first dashboard is about stock prices. In this Dashboard, three tabs are shown to present 1-day candlestick plot, 1-week candlestick plot and 1-month candlestick plot. Moving average lines are also provided here. You can choose moving average of 5, 10, 20 or 30. Mulitple lines can be applied at the same time.

#### 2. Stock Prediction
The second dashboard is about a prediction model of this stock. An Auto ARIMA model from pmdarima package is used here to have a real-time prediction of tomorrow's stock price. 

#### 3.  The Layout of This Web Application
Here is a quick gif to show the layout of the whole application.
